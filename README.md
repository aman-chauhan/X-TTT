***Xtreme Tic Tac Toe*** - This game should never have been THIS complicated.

"Hey Aman! Do you know how to implement Tic-Tac-Toe in a client-server setting?"

My friend asked a simple question. My mind started racing and this is what it conjured up ->

> Modeling a game of Tic-Tac-Toe as a state machine, with client's playing the game on an instance of the state machine with the server. Treat the AI as another process that can be replicated on the server, which acts as the player 2 on an instance of a game.

It was just supposed to be a simple game of Tic Tac Toe, but when you work on solving problems at scale everyday, you overcomplicate even the simple things. I swear implementing this game shouldn't be this complicated.
